<h2 id="inferschema"> InferSchema </h2>

The Coalesce InferSchema UDN is a versatile node infers schema of the file in internal or external stage and dynamically creates the target table of the same name as inferschema node.

[InferSchema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/infer_schema) in Snowflake automatically detects the file metadata schema in a set of staged data files that contain semi-structured data and retrieves the column definitions.

### InferSchema Prerequisites

* A sample file in the internal or external stage.
* An existing fileformat to parse the file
* The file format is also expected to be in the same location as stage

### InferSchema Node Configuration

The InferSchema node type has two configuration groups:

* [InferSchema Node Properties](#inferschema-node-properties)
* [InferSchema Source Data](#inferschema-source-data)

Go to the node and select the **Config tab** to see the Node Properties, Dynamic Table Options and General Options.

<h4 id="inferschema-node-properties"> InferSchema Node Properties </h4>

* **Storage Location**: Storage Location where the WORK will be created.
* **Node Type**: Name of template used to create node objects.
* **Description**: A description of the node's purpose.
* **Deploy Enabled**:
  * If TRUE the node will be deployed / redeployed when changes are detected.
  * If FALSE the node will not be deployed or will be dropped during redeployment.
  
<h4 id="inferschema-source-data"> InferSchema Source Data </h4>


* **Stage Storage Location (Required)**: A storage location in Coalesce where the stage is located.
* **Stage Name (Required)***: Internal or External stage where the files containing data to be loaded are staged.
* **File Names (Required)**: Use commas to seperate multiple files. File whose metatdata is to be inferred.
* **File Format Name (Required)***: Name of the file format object that describes the data contained in the staged files.It is expected in the same location as Stage.
* **Redeployment Behavior**:
  * **CREATE OR REPLACE**: Dynamically creates target table based on the inferred schema from file in staging area.
  * **ALTER EXISTING TABLE**: Dynamically alters inferred table by comparing the inferred schema of the same file (with changes if any)and created table.
  * **DROP EXISTING TABLE**: Drops the table inferred.

### InferSchema Example workflow

* Add a InferSchema node, for example `INFER_JSON`.
* Deploy the node. On deployment a table of the same name as the InferSchema node is created with columns inferred on parsing the file. For example, `InferSchema node:INFER_JSON,Inferred table:INFER_JSON`.
* Add the inferred table to the browser using Add Sources tab.
* Now we can add a Copy-Into Snowpipe or External table node on top of the inferred table to load staged files.
* If the structure of the file is changed, you can redeploy the InferSchema node with "Alter existing table" redeployment behaviour. The already inferred table is altered.
* Next, you can re-sync the columns of the inferred table and redeploy the CopyInto Copy-Into Snowpipe or External table node added on top of it.

> üöß Inferred table and Copy-into nodes/External table cannot be deployed together
>
> Infer Schema node, inferred table and Copy-into nodes/External table cannot be deployed together. First deploy the Infer Schema node. Then add the inferred table in browser, add Copy-into node on top of the table and then deploy the same.

### InferSchema Deployment

#### InferSchema Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the InferSchema node will execute the stage:

* Stage executed: **Infer and Create target table**

#### InferSchema Redeployment

**Redeployment Behavior: Create or Replace**

| Redeployment Behavior | Stage Executed |
|---|---|
| Create or Replace | Infer and Create target table

If any of the Source Data options like Stage storage location, Stage name or filename are modified.
Then you can redeploy the Infer Schema node with redeployment behaviour ‚ÄúCreate or Replace‚Äù.

> üìò Info
> 
> You can go back to the browser and Re-sync columns of Inferred table, re-execute Copy-Into and redeploy

**Redeployment Behavior: Alter Existing Table**

| Redeployment Behavior | Stage Executed |
|---|---|
|Alter existing table| Infer and Alter target table

If all Source Data options remain same and only there are changes in the existing file structure, you can redeploy the Infer Schema node with redeployment behaviour ‚ÄúAlter existing table‚Äù.

**Redeployment Behavior: Drop Existing Table**

| Redeployment Behavior | Stage Executed |
|---|---|
|Drop existing table |Drop inferred table

If you want to drop the inferred table you can redeploy the Infer Schema node with redeployment behaviour ‚ÄúDrop existing table‚Äù.
  
### InferSchema Undeployment

If the InferSchema node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher-level environment then no action takes place.

### CopyInto - Snowpipe Deployment

#### CopyInto Snowpipe Deployment Parameters

The CopyInto-Snowpipe includes an environment parameter that allows you to specify if you want to perform a full load or a reload based on the load type when you are performing a Copy-Into operation.

The parameter name is `loadType` and the default value is ``.

```json
{
    "loadType": ""
}
```

When the parameter value is set to `Reload`, the data is reloaded into the table regardless of whether they‚Äôve been loaded previously and have not changed since they were loaded.

#### CopyInto - Snowpipe Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the CopyInto-Snowpipe node will execute the below stage depending on if Snowpipe is enabled and the `loadType`.

| Deployment Behavior  | Enable Snowpipe |Stages Executed|
|--|--|---|--|
|  Initial Deployment | `false` | empty|Create Table. </br> Historical full load using CopyInto. |
| Initial Deployment | `false` | `Reload` | Truncate Target Table </br> Reload data-Copy Into Force|

### CopyInto - Snowpipe Redeployment

#### Altering the CopyInto-Snowpipe Tables

There are few column or table changes like Change in table name, Dropping existing column,  Alter Column data type, Adding a new column if made in isolation or all-together will result in an ALTER statement to modify the target Table in the target environment.Any table level changes or node config changes results in recreation of pipe

The following stages are executed:

* **Rename Table| Alter Column | Delete Column | Add Column| Edit table description |**: Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation.
* **Create Pipe**: Pipe is recreated if enable snowpipe option is true
* **Historical full load using CopyInto**:Historical data are loaded

### CopyInto - Snowpipe Undeployment

If the CopyInto-Snowpipe node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher-level environment then the target table in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in two stages:

* **Drop Table**: Target table is dropped
* **Drop Pipe**: Pipe is dropped


<h2 id="CopyIntoSnowpipe">CopyInto - Snowpipe </h2>

The Coalesce CopyInto - Snowpipe node is a node that performs two operations. It can be used to load historical data using     
 [CopyInto](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table). CopyInto-Snowpipe node can be used to create a pipe to auto ingest files from AWS, GCP, or Azure.

[Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro) enables loading data from files as soon as they‚Äôre available in a stage. 

This means you can load data from files in micro-batches, making it available to users within minutes, rather than manually executing COPY statements on a schedule to load larger batches.

The subsequent deployment of External table with changes in config options will recreate the table.

The following stages are executed:
