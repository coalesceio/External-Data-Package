<h2 id="inferschema"> InferSchema </h2>

The Coalesce InferSchema UDN is a versatile node infers schema of the file in internal or external stage and dynamically creates the target table of the same name as inferschema node.

[InferSchema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/infer_schema) in Snowflake automatically detects the file metadata schema in a set of staged data files that contain semi-structured data and retrieves the column definitions.

### InferSchema Prerequisites

* A sample file in the internal or external stage.
* An existing fileformat to parse the file
* The file format is also expected to be in the same location as stage

### InferSchema Node Configuration

The InferSchema node type has two configuration groups:

* [InferSchema Node Properties](#inferschema-node-properties)
* [InferSchema Source Data](#inferschema-source-data)

Go to the node and select the **Config tab** to see the Node Properties, Dynamic Table Options and General Options.

<h4 id="inferschema-node-properties"> InferSchema Node Properties </h4>

* **Storage Location**: Storage Location where the WORK will be created.
* **Node Type**: Name of template used to create node objects.
* **Description**: A description of the node's purpose.
* **Deploy Enabled**:
  * If TRUE the node will be deployed / redeployed when changes are detected.
  * If FALSE the node will not be deployed or will be dropped during redeployment.
  
<h4 id="inferschema-source-data"> InferSchema Source Data </h4>

* **Stage Storage Location (Required)**: A storage location in Coalesce where the stage is located.
* **Stage Name (Required)***: Internal or External stage where the files containing data to be loaded are staged.
* **File Names (Required)**: Use commas to seperate multiple files. File whose metatdata is to be inferred.
* **File Format Name (Required)***: Name of the file format object that describes the data contained in the staged files.It is expected in the same location as Stage.
* **Redeployment Behavior**:
  * **CREATE OR REPLACE**: Dynamically creates target table based on the inferred schema from file in staging area.
  * **ALTER EXISTING TABLE**: Dynamically alters inferred table by comparing the inferred schema of the same file (with changes if any)and created table.
* **DROP EXISTING TABLE**: Drops the table inferred.

### InferSchema Usage

#### Option1-With deployment
* Add a InferSchema node, for example `INFER_JSON`.
* Deploy the node. On deployment a table of the same name as the InferSchema node is created with columns inferred on parsing the file. For example, `InferSchema node:INFER_JSON,Inferred table:INFER_JSON`.
* Add the inferred table to the browser using Add Sources tab.
* Now we can add a Copy-Into Snowpipe or External table node on top of the inferred table to load staged files.
* If the structure of the file is changed, you can redeploy the InferSchema node with "Alter existing table" redeployment behaviour. The already inferred table is altered.
* Next, you can re-sync the columns of the inferred table and redeploy the CopyInto Copy-Into Snowpipe or External table node added on top of it.
> üöß Inferred table and Copy-into nodes/External table cannot be deployed together
>
> Infer Schema node, inferred table and Copy-into nodes/External table cannot be deployed together. First deploy the Infer Schema node. Then add the inferred table in browser, add Copy-into node on top of the table and then deploy the same.

#### Option2-Without deployment
* Add a InferSchema node, for example `INFER_JSON` and hit create.'Infer and Create table' stage runs and creates a table with the same name as InferSchema node.
* Add the inferred table to the browser using Add Sources tab.
* Now we can add a Copy-Into,Snowpipe or External table node on top of the inferred table to load staged files.
* Once we get the required metadata columns in our downstream node(Copy-Into,Snowpipe or External table),bulk edit the source in the node to be blank.Also delete the from clause in the Join tab.These information are not required for Copy-Into,Snowpipe or External table to  load data from files.
* Delete the inferred table/source table for the downstream nodes mentioned step2.
* Delete the inferschema node ,we created in step1 as we have derived all the columns required for the downstream nodes and the data for the same are derived from files.
* Eventually Inferschema nodes are not required to be deployed.It is sufficient to deploy the Copy-into,Snowpipe or External table nodes which holds the data from staged files


### InferSchema Deployment

#### InferSchema Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the InferSchema node will execute the stage:

* Stage executed: **Infer and Create target table**

#### InferSchema Redeployment

**Redeployment Behavior: Create or Replace**

| Redeployment Behavior | Stage Executed |
|---|---|
| Create or Replace | Infer and Create target table

If any of the Source Data options like Stage storage location, Stage name or filename are modified.
Then you can redeploy the Infer Schema node with redeployment behaviour ‚ÄúCreate or Replace‚Äù.

> üìò Info
> 
> You can go back to the browser and Re-sync columns of Inferred table, re-execute Copy-Into and redeploy

**Redeployment Behavior: Alter Existing Table**

| Redeployment Behavior | Stage Executed |
|---|---|
|Alter existing table| Infer and Alter target table

If all Source Data options remain same and only there are changes in the existing file structure, you can redeploy the Infer Schema node with redeployment behaviour ‚ÄúAlter existing table‚Äù.

**Redeployment Behavior: Drop Existing Table**

| Redeployment Behavior | Stage Executed |
|---|---|
|Drop existing table |Drop inferred table

If you want to drop the inferred table you can redeploy the Infer Schema node with redeployment behaviour ‚ÄúDrop existing table‚Äù.
  
### InferSchema Undeployment

If the InferSchema node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher-level environment then no action takes place.

### Key points to use CopyInto node
* CopyInto node can be created by just clicking on Create node from browser if we want the data from the file to be loaded into single variant column in target table.
* CopyInto node can be added on top of an inferred table(table created by running the inferschema node) if you want to load data into specific columns as defined in the files.Refer to Inferschema to know more on how to use the node and add Copy-Into on top of it.

### CopyInto Deployment

#### CopyInto Deployment Parameters

The CopyInto-Snowpipe includes an environment parameter that allows you to specify if you want to perform a full load or a reload based on the load type when you are performing a Copy-Into operation.

The parameter name is `loadType` and the default value is ``.

```json
{
    "loadType": ""
}
```

When the parameter value is set to `Reload`, the data is reloaded into the table regardless of whether they‚Äôve been loaded previously and have not changed since they were loaded.

#### CopyInto Initial Deployment
When deployed for the first time into an environment the Copy-into node of materialization type table will execute the below stage:

| Deployment Behavior  | Load Type | Stages Executed |
|--|--|--|
| Initial Deployment | ``|Create Table/Transient Table
| Initial Deployment | Reload| Truncate Target table </br> Create Table/Transient Table

### CopyInto Redeployment

#### Altering the CopyInto Tables

There are few column or table changes like Change in table name,Dropping existing column, Alter Column data type,Adding a new column if made in isolation or all-together will result in an ALTER statement to modify the Work Table in the target environment.

The following stages are executed:

* **Rename Table| Alter Column | Delete Column | Add Column | Edit table description**: Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation.

#### Copy-Into change in materialization type

When the materialization type of Copy-Into node is changed from table to transient table or viceversa,the below stages are executed:

* **Drop table/transient table**
* **Create transient table/table**

### CopyInto Undeployment

If the CopyInto-Snowpipe node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher-level environment then the target table in the target environment will be dropped.

* **Drop table/transient table**: Target table in Snowflake is dropped

<h2 id="Snowpipe">Snowpipe </h2>

The Coalesce Snowpipe node is a node that performs two operations. It can be used to load historical data using     
 [CopyInto](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/copy-into-table). Also the Snowpipe node can be used to create a pipe to auto ingest files from AWS, GCP, or Azure.

[Snowpipe](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-intro) enables loading data from files as soon as they‚Äôre available in a stage. 

This means you can load data from files in micro-batches, making it available to users within minutes, rather than manually executing COPY statements on a schedule to load larger batches.

### Snowpipe Deployment

#### Snowpipe Deployment Parameters

The Snowpipe includes twp environment parameters.The parameter `loadType` allows you to specify if you want to perform a full load or a reload based on the load type 
when you are performing a Copy-Into operation.
The another parameter `targetIntegrationOrAwsSNSTopic` allows you to specify the AWS SNS Topic or Integration name to be used for auto ingesting files from Clous providers

The parameter name is `loadType` and the default value is ``.

```json
{
    "loadType": ""
}
```

When the parameter value is set to `Reload`, the data is reloaded into the table regardless of whether they‚Äôve been loaded previously 
and have not changed since they were loaded.

The parameter name is targetIntegrationOrAwsSNSTopic and the default value is DEV ENVIRONMENT.

When set to DEV ENVIRONMENT the value entered in the Snowpipe Options config AWS SNS TOpic/Integration is used for ingesting files from Cloud providers.

```
{
    "targetIntegrationOrAwsSNSTopic": "DEV ENVIRONMENT"
}
```

When set to any value other than DEV ENVIRONMENT the node will use the specified value for AWS SNS TOpic/Integration.

For example, the Snowpipe node will use the specific value for auto ingestion.

```
{
    "targetIntegrationOrAwsSNSTopic": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:832620633027:sf-snowpipe-AIDA4DXAOTPB7IF437EPD-lZe8ciYpPqGgC9KwWLmiIQ"
}
```

#### Snowpipe Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the Snowpipe node will execute the below stages depending on if Enable Snowpipe is enabled,'Load Historical Data' is enabled and the `loadType` parameter.

| Deployment Behavior  | Enable Snowpipe | Historical Load | Load Type | Stages Executed |
|--|--|---|--|--|
| Initial Deployment | Enable Snowpipe |true| ``|Create Table </br> Historical full load using CopyInto </br> Create Pipe </br> Alter Pipe 
| Initial Deployment | Enable Snowpipe |true| Reload|Create table </br> Truncate Target table </br> Historical full load using CopyInto </br> Create Pipe </br> Alter Pipe
| Initial Deployment | Enable Snowpipe |false| Reload or Empty|Create table </br> Truncate Target table </br> Create Pipe
| Initial Deployment | Test Copy Statement |false| Reload or Empty|Create table </br> Test Copy Statement-No pipe creation

### Snowpipe Redeployment

#### Altering the Snowpipe node

There are few column or table changes like Change in table name, Dropping existing column,  Alter Column data type, Adding a new column if made in isolation or all-together will result in an ALTER statement to modify the target Table in the target environment.Any table level changes or node config changes results in recreation of pipe

The following stages are executed:

* **Rename Table| Alter Column | Delete Column | Add Column| Edit table description |**: Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation.
* **Truncate target table**:The target table is truncated in case the Load Type parameter is set to 'Reload'
* **Historical full load using CopyInto**:Historical data are loaded if 'Load Historical' toggle is on.
* **Create Pipe**: Pipe is recreated if enable snowpipe option is true
* **Alter Pipe**:Pipe is refreshed if 'Load Historical' toggle is on.

### Snowpipe Undeployment

If the Snowpipe node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher-level environment then the target table in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in two stages:

* **Drop Table**: Target table is dropped
* **Drop Pipe**: Pipe is dropped

## External Tables

The Coalesce External Table nodes create a new external table in the current/specified schema or replaces an existing external table.

An [external table](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-external-table#examples) reads data from a set of one or more files in a specified external stage which can point to AWS,GCP or Azure cloud providers.

### External Tables Node Configuration

The External table node type has four configuration groups:

* [Node Properties](#external-tables-node-properties)
* [File Location](#external-tables-file-location)
* [File Format](#external-tables-ile-format)
